# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100-days-of-code.

**Thoughts:** I want to work in some projects that will be useful in my masters degree. For the first round i plan to create a full LaTeX presentation template to use it in future oral presentations. The next round will include applications in Big Data using Spark in Scala. For the third round i plan to learn more about TensorFlow and its applications in deep learning. Those will be the initial goals, but the plan is to include some more related to Machine Learning.


### Day 1: January 11, 2018

## LaTeX Presentation

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about the beamer class in LaTeX.

**Thoughts**: You can start doing things in LaTeX in sites like sharelatex.com or overleaf.com (the last one bought sharelatex recently). These sites are good if you are starting learning about LaTeX, since there are some templates online and the packages needed (as beamer) are already installed. But for this proyect I first installed MiKTeX [1] which is something like the programming language. Then I installed TeXstudio [2], which is the program where the code is inserted and the documents are created. Finally I installed the beamer package using the MiKTex package installer that came with the MiKTeX installation.
  As the first task in this proyect, I'll try to cover the basics in the beamer package by following the guide of ShareLaTeX. Also, ill use the package blindtext to generate dummy text to fill the slides. For now I finished the Introduction and Title parts of the guide, with minor changes as changing the name and using the logo of my University.
  Updated the project [4]

### Day 2: January 12, 2018

## LaTeX Presentation

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ShareLaTeX beamer guide.

**Thoughts:** I just finished the basic features in a presentation, such as adding a "Table of Contents" or adding "Transitions Effects" between the slides. The next thins I want to do is include graphics such as images, plots, or customable diagrams.
